Hi, I'm Saran Siriphantnon. I'm a coder. Currently I'm available for hiring (with limited hours) only for backend coding tasks that require high-performance code.

I'm a Rubyist by nature. But I mainly code in Rust and Go.

If you're interested in hiring, please contact my work email at saran@qakka.com.
